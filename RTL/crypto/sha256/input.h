const char* fileInput = "Lincoln Laboratory is a Federally Funded Research and Development \
Center (FFRDC) focused on the development and prototyping of new \
technologies and capabilities to meet national security \
needs. Principal core competencies are in sensors, information \
extraction (signal processing and embedded computing), communications, \
integrated sensing, and decision support. Program activities extend \
from fundamental investigations through design and field testing of \
prototype systems using new technologies. \
\
Lincoln Laboratory continues to meet the governmentâ€™s FFRDC goals of \
providing independent perspective on critical issues, maintaining \
long-term competency, and developing technology for both long-term \
interests and short-term, high-priority needs. The Laboratory also \
places a strong emphasis on transitioning its innovative systems and \
technology to the military services, government agencies, industry, \
and academia. On its 25th and 50th anniversaries, the Laboratory \
received the Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service \
in recognition of its distinguished technical innovation and \
scientific discoveries.";
